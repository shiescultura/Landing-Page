# Camden Voucher Design Page #

Please find the layouts for the example Camden Market voucher campaign within the `layouts` which need to be built as a responsive html page.

```
camden-market-voucher-campaign-layouts.pdf
```
This file shows the layout for both desktop (page 1) and mobile (page 2). It shows which fonts are used for the header and footer (Camden Slab)

In the `webfonts` folder, you will find the various webfonts that can be used to build the headings in the page (Camden Slab).

The main body text in the forms is Roboto and should be pulled in from google fonts

## The task ##

- Build a responsive page in html and css that changes for mobile and desktop screens based on the designs in the pdf
- Elements such as the heading text do change on mobile so these need to be updated how you see fit (example, using media queries to hide based on screen size or javascript)
- The form only needs the elements for layout purposes. You do not need to include validation or a submit action but you can do so if you wish
- Using bootstrap for the css would be useful 
- Using bootstrap with scss would be ideal but not required
- On the desktop layout, the content of the page should be vertically aligned in the center of the browser window and should use breakpoints for large and medium sized screens so it fits.
- The mobile layout works like a normal scrolling page

## Notes ##

- I have included psd files in the `layouts` folder in case this is useful
- The original file is the .ai file which is Adobe illustator format.
